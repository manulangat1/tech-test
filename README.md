## By Emmanuel Kipchirchir Langat

### Description and idea of the project

The main idea of the project is to enable one to cross post  to various blogging platforms

The functionalities are detailed below:

* Users can sign up via email  (Social auth will be added later on)
* User can connect to their medium , hashnode and dev.to accounts (Twitter will be added later on)
* Users are able to create tutorials and content
* Users are able to post the content to the connected accounts
* Users are able to schedule posts ( date and time and should vary according to the account )
* Users are able to connect to their blogs via a rest api and fetch all their  posts.

### Set up instructions

This bit is still in the pipelines.
